**Questions:**

**1-** What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation?

**Freedom 0** – The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.

**Freedom 1** – The freedom to study how the program works and change it to suit your needs.

**Freedom 2** – The freedom to redistribute copies of the software to help others.

**Freedom 3** – The freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, giving the community the benefit of your improvements.

**2-** How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?

**Freedom and Cooperation:** Proprietary software creates artificial scarcity and restricts users from modifying or sharing programs. Free software encourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

**Control Over Technology:** When software is proprietary, users are at the mercy of corporations, who control updates, features, and security. Free software allows individuals and communities to decide how technology serves them.

**Social Good Over Profit:** The manifesto argues that prioritizing profit over user freedom is unjust. Since software is infinitely replicable at no cost, restricting its use for financial gain is seen as unethical.

**Encouraging Innovation:** Free access to software allows developers to build upon existing tools, leading to greater technological progress.

**3-** What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?

Free software is a movement for user freedom, while open source is a development model that prioritizes efficiency. All free software is open source, but not all open source software is free software.

**Essay (300 words):**

The ethical dilemma presented in the article revolves around the use of copyrighted material by AI companies particularly Chinese firms to train large language models. Anna’s Archive, an illegal digital repository, argues that copyright laws must be reformed to prevent Western nations from falling behind in AI development. The tension lies in balancing the moral duty to preserve and distribute knowledge against the legal and economic rights of content creators.

This issue directly relates to the principles of software libre, especially those concerning freedom, transparency, and user rights. The open-source movement has long advocated for the unrestricted distribution of knowledge, arguing that access to information fosters innovation and societal progress. However, the principles of software libre also emphasize ethical use and proper attribution. While free software encourages open access, it typically respects the creator’s intent, something that large scale copyright infringement disregards. Transparency is another key value while Anna’s Archive openly admits its practices, many LLM companies, particularly those in China, obscure the sources of their training data, raising concerns about fairness and accountability.

From a philosophical standpoint, my stance aligns with a utilitarian perspective: copyright laws should balance the well-being of society with the rights of individual creators. If a shorter copyright term enhances technological and scientific progress while still compensating creators, it could be a reasonable compromise. However, outright disregarding copyright in favor of AI development sets a dangerous precedent—one where corporate and state interests override ethical considerations. Instead, a transparent, regulated framework for AI training that includes fair-use principles and licensing agreements would be more ethical and sustainable. Reform is necessary, but it must ensure that both innovation and intellectual property rights are respected.
